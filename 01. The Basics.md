
# # The Basics
## ## Basic CLI Commands
**CLI** is Angular **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface that helps you to create and manage your Angular projects. 

For CLI to work, you must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) first to work with its package ecosystem **npm**.

### Install CLI:
- After installing Node.js, run **Command line** as administrator and **install CLI**:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

### Create a new project:
- To **create a new project**, navigate to your workspace folder where you want to create your project with a 
command `cd <path>`,
- create **new project** in the folder:
```bash
cd <path>
ng new <name-of-project>
```
- if asked about **routing**, answer `N`,
- if asked about **styles**, pick based on your preference, if you do not know, pick `CSS` option.

### Run your project (app) in your browser:
- Navigate to your **project folder**,
- **run** your app:
```bash
cd <name-of-project>
ng serve --open
```
- your browser will open and load `http://localhost:4200/`, which is a port where your server is hosted,
- you may omit `--open`, this way, the server is still going to run on a _4200 port_, you will only have to type the address `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser manually.

### Install Angular Material
- Modern CSS UI and components support [(more info)](https://material.angular.io/):
```bash
ng add @angular/material
```

### Create a new component:
- by default, new components are created in `app` folder:
```bash
ng generate component <component-name>
```
- Shorter command: `ng g c <component-name>`, 
- to create a new component in a different folder, **define path** in the command:
```bash
ng generate component <component-path>/<component-name>
```
- or `ng g c <component-path>/<component-name>`,
- the folder `component-path` doesn't have to exist yet, if so, the folder will be created along with the new component.

### Create a new directive:
- by default, new directives are created in `app` folder:
```bash
ng generate directive <directive-name>
```
- Shorter command: `ng g d <directive-name>`, 
- to create a new directive in a different folder, **define path** in the command:
```bash
ng generate directive <directive-path>/<directive-name>
```
- or `ng g d <directive-path>/<directive-name>`,
- the folder `component-path` doesn't have to exist yet, if so, the folder will be created along with the new component.

## ## Component Template
Template is represented by your HTML (or HTML-like) code. Template **must be defined** in your component (selector and styles may be omitted).

There are **two ways** to include your HTML code, with inline template or with external file template:

### Inline Template - ONE LINE of code
- assign property **template** to your component, 
- write only one line of HTML code inside **single quotation marks**:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: '<app-child></app-child><app-child></app-child>',
  styleUrls: ['./parent.component.css']
})
```

### Inline Template - MULTIPLE LINES of code
- assign property **template** to your component, 
- write multiple lines of HTML code inside **backticks**:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: `
	<app-child></app-child>
	<app-child></app-child>`,
  styleUrls: ['./parent.component.css']
})
```

### External File Template _(default)_
- assign property **templateUrl** to your component, 
- add **path** to template **.html** file,
- add **all HTML code** inside that .html file:
```typescript
// component .ts file
@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  templateUrl: './parent.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./parent.component.css']
})
```
```html
<!-- component .html file -->
<app-child></app-child>
<app-child></app-child>
```

## ## Component Styles
Styles are represented by your CSS code.

There are **two ways** to include your CSS code, with inline styles or with external style file(s):

### Inline Styles - ONE or MULTIPLE LINES of code
- assign property **styles** to your component, 
- write one or multiple lines of CSS code inside **brackets** and **backticks**:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'post-component',
  templateUrl: './post.component.html',
  styles: [`
	h3 {
      color: red;
      line-height: 25px;
    }
  `]
})
```

### External Style File(s) _(default)_
- assign property **styleUrls** to your component (it's an **array**), 
- add **path(s)** to **.css** style file(s),
- add **all CSS code** inside that/those .css file(s),
- setting paths to **multiple files is allowed**,
- paths to .css files are inside **an array**:
```typescript
// component .ts file
@Component({
  selector: 'post-component',
  templateUrl: './post.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./post.component.css', './post-mobile.component.css']
})
```
```css
/*.css style file */
h3 {
  color: red;
  line-height: 25px;
}
```

## ## Component Selector
Identifies this component in the template and triggers instantiation of the component.

Component selector:
- has to be unique,
- works as CSS selector,
- can be used in template HTML as: 
  - opening and closing **tag** of HTML-like element,
  - **attribute** of any HTML element, 
  - **class** of any HTML element,
- cannot be used as _id_ and _pseudo selectors (hover and so on)_:
```typescript
// component .ts file
@Component({
  //selector as TAG
  selector: 'post-component',
  //or selector as ATTRIBUTE
  selector: '[post-component]',
  //or selector as CLASS
  selector: '.post-component',

  templateUrl: './post.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./post.component.css', './post-mobile.component.css']
})
```
```html
<!-- component .html file -->
  <!-- selector as TAG -->
  <app-post-component></app-post-component>

  <!-- or selector as ATTRIBUTE -->
  <div app-post-component></div>

  <!-- or selector as CLASS -->
  <div class="app-post-component"></div>
```

## ## Databinding
Databinding is **communication** between your **logic** (.ts file) and your **template** (.html file).

**Output Data** (logic → template)
- **String interpolation** `{{ typescriptExpression }}`
- **Property binding** `[property]="typescriptExpression"`

**User Events** (logic ← template)
- **Event binding** `(event)="typescriptExpression"`

**Both Directions** (logic ↔ template)
- **Two-Way binding** `[(ngModel)]="typescriptExpression"`
***

### String Interpolation

- In **.ts file**, define your logic,
- in **.html file**, reference that logic with your TypeScript expression inside **double braces {{ }}** as long as that expression can be resolved as a **string** in the end (or can be converted to a string, like numbers),
- you cannot use bloc expression (multiple-line code):
```typescript
// .ts file (logic)
age: number = 24;
name: string = 'John';

getName() {
  return this.name;
}
```

```html
<!-- .html file (template) -->
<p>{{ 'Hello, ' }} my name is {{ getName() }} and I am {{ age }} years old.</p>
```

### Property Binding
Dinamically setting a property of a **view element**: 
- HTML element, 
- directive, 
- component

```typescript
// .ts file (logic)
clickable: boolean = false;

constructor() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.clickable = true;
  }, 5000);
}
```

```html
<!-- .html file (template) -->
<button [disabled]="clickable">Click me when you can!</button>

<!-- after 5 seconds the button becomes clickable -->
```

### Event Binding
 Logic changes as a reaction to user related events. 

#### SIMPLE EVENT BINDING:
 - In **.html file**, define the event type you want to bind to the HTML element (for example _click_) inside **parentheses ()**, 
 - assign your TypeScript expression to the event, usually a name of a method you want to be executed after the event,
 - do not forget to add the **parantheses to tha name of the method** when binding to an event in HTML tag:
 ```typescript
// .ts file (logic)
clickStatus: string = 'Button was never clicked.';

onButtonClick() {
  this.clickStatus = 'Button was clicked.';
}
```

```html
<!-- .html file (template) -->
<button (click)="onButtonClick()">Click me!</button>
<p> {{ clickStatus }} </p>

<!-- 
  {{ clickStatus }} before clicking: <p>Button was never clicked.</p>
  {{ clickStatus }} after clicking: <p>Button was clicked.</p>
 -->
```

#### EVENT BINDING USING $event:
With an event **input** you can acess user's input. 
**Value** of the user's input can become part of the component's logic by assigning 
**$event** as a parameter of the method we are calling after the **input** event.

**1. step**
- In **.ts file**, define a property of type string, let it be empty,
 ```typescript
userInput: string = ''; //empty string
```

**2. step**
- In **.ts file**, define a method that will be called after the event,
- pass **event** of type **Event** (or any) as a parameter of the method,
- assign the value of user's input (you must inform TypeScript about the 
type of event - that it is an HTML element):
 ```typescript
onTypingInput(event: Event) {
  this.userInput = (<HTMLInputElement>.event.target).value;
}
```

**3. step**
- In **.html file**, bind the event to the HTML input tag, 
- pass **$event** as a parameter of the method:
```html
<input (input)="onTypingInput($event)">
<p>{{ userInput }}</p>

<!-- user's input will be also rendered in the paragraph -->
```

### Two-Way Databinding with ng-model
Two-Way Databinding **combines** property and event binding. You combine the syntax using 
**parentheses inside brackets [()]**, then you put the _directive_ **ngModel** inside and assign it your TypeScript property.

With this setup, the binding triggers on the **input** event and **updates the value** of your property (template → logic). 

The **opposite direction** (template ← logic) of binding works as well, for example, the value of the HTML element can be preset in your **.ts file**
 and it will be shown in your template - therefore, two-way binding.

 In order for _ngModel_ to work, in **app.module.ts**, **FormsModule** must be imported from Angular core, and **FormsModule** must be added to the _imports_ of _@NgModule_. 
 ```typescript
// .ts file (logic)
inputValue: string = 'I will be shown right away!';
```

```html
<!-- .html file (template) -->
<input [(ngModel)]="inputValue">
<p>{{ inputValue }}</p>

<!-- 
  inside input and paragraph before typing: I will be shown right away!
  inside input and paragraph after typing 'Hello!': Hello!
 -->
```
