# # Routing
- **Changing the URL** and **the content** of the SPA while **not reloading** the page.

## ## Registering Routes
**1. step**
- In **app.module.ts**, add a constant of a **Routes** type that will hold an **array** of registered routes,
- **import** _Routes_ from Angular router,
```typescript
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';

const appRoutes: Routes = [];
```

**2. step**
- In **app.module.ts**, **import** _RouterModule_ from Angular router, 
- **add** a new import  **RouterModule** to _@NgModule_, 
- **call** a method **forRoot()** on the _RouterModule_ import and **pass** your constant of the Routes type as **an argument** of the method. 
```typescript
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

const appRoutes: Routes = [
    // routes
];

@NgModule({
    // NgModule TypeScript code ...

    imports: [
        // other imports
        RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)
    ],

    // NgModule TypeScript code ...
})
```

**3. step**
- Each route is just an JavaScript object in the array, 
- structure for registering a route: `{ path: 'route', component: RoutePageComponent }`
  - **path** is entered in the URL after the domain of the SPA,
  - **component** is the component of the page that will be loaded,
- **example**:
```typescript
const appRoutes: Routes = [
    { path: 'users', component: UsersComponent }
];
```
- Homepage has **an empty string** in its _path_ definition of the JavaScript object: `{ path: '', component: HomepageComponent }`.

## ## Rendering the Components of the Routes
- In a **parent component .html file** _(app.component.html usually)_, **add** a **Router Outlet** directive as a selector HTML tag in a place, where you would normally put the component selector tag.
```html
<!-- parent-component.component.html -->

<!-- component HTML code -->

    <!-- normally: <app-child-component></app-child-component> -->
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>

<!-- component HTML code -->
```

## ## Navigating with Router Links
### Creating Router Links
- Creating router links is possible with **RouterLink** directive, it can be used in a **HTML link** two ways: 
  - with a link **attribute**: 
    - `<a routerLink="/">Home</a>`,
    - `<a routerLink="/users">Users</a>`,
  - with a link **property binding** with the value as a **string** (must be in single quotes `' '`, it may also be an array `[' ']` for more complex path building):
    - `<a [routerLink]="'/users'">Users</a>`,
    - `<a [routerLink]="['/users']">Users</a>`,
    - `<a [routerLink]="['/users', 'user']">User</a>`.

### Navigation Paths
- **Relative path** or **absolute path** may be used for creating router links:
  - **RELATIVE path**:
    - appends the route to the **current URL** `domain.com/current-path/route`:
      - `<a routerLink="user">` in a **user component** rendered in **users component** (parent component) will result in a `domain.com/users/user` URL link,
    - it is possible to use **folder directory** navigation:
      - current path: `./route` or nothing `/route`,
      - up a level: `../route`,
  - **ABSOLUTE path**: 
    - starts with a backslash `/`,
    - appends the route always to the **domain root** `domain.com/route`:
      - `<a routerLink="/user">` in a **user component** rendered in **users component** (parent component) will result in a `domain.com/user` URL link.

### Styling Active Router Links
- Let's say we have a navigation made of a list of links and we want to 
higlight 
(or in any other way change the CSS) of the **current active link** and also 
the 
**default active link** (_Home_ link for example),
- this can be achieved with a directive **routerLinkActive**, 
- _routerLinkActive_ can be added as an HTML attribute with the value of the 
CSS class highlighting the active link.

**routerLink DIRECTIVE:**
- the attribute is placed to **all the links** either as:  
  - an attribute of the **wrapping element**,
  - an attribute of the **link itself**: 
```html
<!-- in the wrapping element li -->
<li routerLinkActive="active">
    <a routerLink="route">Page</a>
</li>

<!-- in the link itself -->
<li>
    <a routerLink="route" routerLinkActive="active">Page</a>
</li>
```

**routerLinkActive BEHAVIOUR:**
- _routerLinkActive_ directive analyses currently loaded path and checks which
 links lead to a route which uses this path and **by default** marks an 
 element as _active_ and adds the CSS class to it if it **contains** the path 
 you 
 are on, therefore: 
```html
<ul>
    <!-- 1st link:      ALWAYS highlighted as ACTIVE,
                        because the other two links CONTAIN
                        the PATH of the first link
         URL:           domain.com/ -->
    <li><a routerLink="/" routerLinkActive="active">Home</a></li>
    
    <!-- 2nd link path: domain.com/ (which is 1st link path) + users
         URL:           domain.com/users -->
    <li><a routerLink="users" routerLinkActive="active">Users</a></li>
    
    <!-- 3rd link path: domain.com/ (which is 1st link path) + groups
         URL:           domain.com/groups -->
    <li><a routerLink="groups" routerLinkActive="active">Groups</a></li>
</ul>
```

**routerLinkActive AND routerLinkActiveOptions**
- To solve this problem, you can define the **options** of 
_routerLinkActive_ with **routerLinkActiveOptions**, 
- _routerLinkActiveOptions_ is used as **property binding** 
`[routerLinkActiveOptions]` and as a **value** you pass a JavaScript object 
`{exact: true}`,
- with this JavaScript object, the class is **active** only if the **exact 
full path** matches whatever the link leads to,
- therefore, everything would have to be exact, not only part of the path: 
```html
<ul>
    <!-- 1st link:      highlighted only when domain.com/
         URL:           domain.com/ -->
    <li>
        <a routerLink="/" 
        routerLinkActive="active"
        routerLinkActiveOptions="{exact: true}">
            Home
        </a>
    </li>
    <li><a routerLink="users" routerLinkActive="active">Users</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="groups" routerLinkActive="active">Groups</a></li>
</ul>
```

## ## Navigating Programmatically
- Loading a route not by clicking a _routerLink_,
- loading a route by some **action** or **operation** being **executed** (a method and so on). 

**1. step**
- In **.html file**, set up for example a button - after clicking on it, a **method will be executed**:
```html
<button (click)="onButtonClick()">Click me</button>
```

**2. step** 
- In **.ts file**, **import Router** from Angular router:
```typescript
import { Router } from '@angular/router';
```

**3. step**
- In **.ts file**, **inject** the imported router (of type **Router**) to the **component constructor**:
```typescript
constructor(private router: Router) {}
```

**4. step**
- In **.ts file**, after the Router injection, you can use the Router in your component and access its methods,
- **define** your **custom method** (_onButtonClick()_ in this example) and navigate to a route using the injected router:
```typescript
onButtonClick() {
    // some logic being executed and then:
    this.router.navigate(['/users', 'user', 'Jack']);
}
```
- **navigate** method of Router takes an argument of an **array** (items of the array are parts of the router path), the example above will result in `domain.com/users/user/Jack`.

## ## Programmatic Navigation and Relative Paths
- Route _navigate_ method is **unaware** what its **current route (component)** is (unlike _routerLinks_)
- therefore, by default, it **loads** the routes relative to the **root domain** `domain.com`,
- to make it **aware** what route (component) it is on, you must **define** a second argument of the _navigate_ method `{relativeTo: route}` (it is a JavaScript object). 

**1. step**
- In **.html file**, set up for example a button - after clicking on it, a **method will be executed**:
```html
<button (click)="onButtonClick()">Click me</button>
```

**2. step** 
- In **.ts file**, **import Router** and **ActivatedRoute** from Angular router:
```typescript
import { Router, ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
```

**3. step**
- In **.ts file**, **inject** the imported router (of type **Router**) and the current active component route (of type **ActivatedRoute**) to the **component constructor**:
```typescript
constructor(private router: Router, 
            private currentRoute: ActivatedRoute) {}
```

**4. step**
- In **.ts file**, **define** your **custom method** (_onButtonClick()_ in this example) and navigate to a route (consisting of **relative paths**) relative to the current route, 
- to do so, define a JavaScript object as a **second argument** of the _navigate_ Router method like this: `{relativeTo: this.nameOfCurrentRoute}`:
```typescript
onButtonClick() {
    // some logic being executed and then:
    this.router.navigate(['users', 'user', 'Jack'], {relativeTo: this.currentRoute});
}
```

## ## Passing Parameters to Routes and Fetching Parameters
- It is possible to create routes with **dynamic segments** in your path of the route and access those dynamic segments in your logic.

**1. step**
- In **app.module.ts**, in your routes paths definitions, write a **colon** and the name of the **dynamic segment** of the path `/:name-of-the-dynamic-segment` of the dynamic route,
- **example**:
```typescript
const appRoutes: Routes = [
    { path: 'users/:id', component: UserComponent }
    // :id                               segment is dynamic
    // domain.com/users/{ ANYTHING }     will result in loading the UserComponent
];
```

**2. step**
- In a component **.ts file**, for example user.component.ts, **inject** the constructor with _ActivatedRoute_,
- define a property of the class that should contain your **routed dynamic data**:
```typescript
user: {id: number};                             // property with routed dynamic data
constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}   // injected constructer
```


**3. step**
- It depends whether we want to load a routed component and its data only once, or whether we want to be able to detect changes of data on the component caused by the change of the route,
- **for example**: _the data needs to be allowed to be updated when going from an already loaded component's variation (for instance from user A) to another variation (user B)_,
- types of fetching the parameters (data): 
  - **First Initialization**:
    - Works only (generates correct data), when component is loaded after (from) a different component,
    - changes on the same component (from within) will **not update** the generated data,
    - in **ngOnInit()**, use `route.snapshot.params['dynamic-segment']` method to access the dynamic segment of the path of the route,
  - **Subsequent Changes**:
    - Updating changes of the data due to a route changes (loading the same component from the same component) can be achieved with an **observable**,
    - in **ngOnInit()**, use `route.params.subscribe()` observable to access the dynamic segment of the path of the route,
    - don't forget to include _Params_ to your **imports** `import { Router, ActivatedRoute, Params } from '@angular/router';`,
    - _note: Angular destroys the subscription on ngOnDestroy() on its own, you must unsubscribe on your own when creating your own observables!
 ```typescript
ngOnInit() {
    this.user = {
        // first initialization
        id: this.route.snapshot.params['id']
    };
    // in case of subsequent changes - with an observable
    this.route.params
      .subscribe(
          // executes whenever the parameters change from within (on the same component)
          (params: Params) => {
              this.user.id = params['id'];
          }
      );
}
```

## ## Passing Query Parameters and Fragments
- **Examples** of additional router information: 
  - **query parameters**, separated by a question mark `?`, multiples with a `&` sign, `domain.com/users/John/?mode=editing`,
  - **hash fragments**, marked with a `#` sign, `domain.com/users/John/#loading`. 
- You can **pass** and **retrieve** them.   

- Assume you have a router: `{path: 'users/:name/edit', component: EditUserComponent}`, you can pass its query parameters and fragments with: 

### With routerLinks
- Let's have a routerLink `<a [routerLink]="['/users', 'John', 'edit']">Edit</a>`,
- by adding routerLink binding property **[queryParams]** and passing it **key value pairs** as a JavaScript object `{}`, you create a **QUERY PARAMETER** (multiple key value pairs are allowed, they will be separated by `&` sign in the URL),
- by adding routerLink binding property **[fragment]** and passing it a name of the fragment as a `'string'`, you create a **FRAGMENT** (multiple fragments are not allowed),
  - _note: omitting square brackets and string single quotation marks will work as well_, `fragment="loading"`.
```html
<a [routerLink]="['/users', 'John', 'edit']"
   [queryParams]="{allowEdit: '1'}"
   [fragment]="'loading'">Edit</a>    
   <!-- fragment="loading" would work as well -->

   <!-- URL after clicking on the routerLink:
        domain.com/users/John/edit?allowEdit=1#loading -->
```
