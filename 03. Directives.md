# # Directives

- Directives are **instructions** in the **DOM**,
- they can be with a template (components) or without, 
- typically we add directives with an **attribute**, 
- they can be configured into **class** or **element** as well 
(much like _selector_ for components),
- in Angular, they are **built-in directives** and we can make 
our own **custom directives** as well.
