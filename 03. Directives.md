# # Directives

- Directives are **instructions** in the **DOM**,
- they can be with a template (components) or without, 
- typically we add directives with an **attribute**, 
- they can be configured into **class** or **element** as well 
(much like _selector_ for components),
- in Angular, they are **built-in directives** and we can make 
our own **custom directives** as well,
- **structural directives** are marked with a **star ***, they **change
the structure*** of the DOM (the element either is or is not added).

## ## Directive ngIf
- Shows content conditionally,
- **structural** (*ngIf)

**Syntax:**
```html
<element *ngIf="expression returning true or false">
```

**EXAMPLE:**

**1. step**
- Let's have a button set up with event binding, after clicking we call a method:
```typescript
// component .ts file
paragraphText: string;

onButtonClick() {
    this.paragraphText = 'Button was clicked!';
}
```
```html
<!-- component .html file -->
<button (click)="onButtonClick()">Click me to show a message!</button>
```

**2. step**
- Let's show the _text_ in a paragraph only if the button was cliked,
- in **.ts file**, set up a property of a boolean type and assign it to **false**:
```typescript
isButtonClicked = false;
```

**3. step**
- In **.ts file**, include the property to the method called after 
clicking and assign it to **true**:
```typescript
onButtonClick() {
    this.paragraphText = 'Button was clicked!';
    this.isButtonClicked = true;
}
```

**4. step**
- In **.html file**, add the paragraph conditionally with ***ngIf** with your 
**boolean expression**:
```html
<p *ngIf="isButtonClicked">{{ paragraphText }}</p>
```

_Paragraph conditionally shows based on the state of isButtonClicked, we change its state 
with the method that is called after clicking on the button._
