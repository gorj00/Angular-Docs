# # Dependency Injection (Services)
- A class receives its **dependecies** from **external sources** (basic TypeScript class) rather than creating them itself manually (with ~~new Service()~~),
- follow a convention of naming services **name-of-service.service.ts**. 

## ## Injecting a Service to a Component
**1. step**
- Create a **.service.ts file**, which will be your new service that you will be injecting into a component, and define its **attributes** and **methods**:
```typescript
export class ServiceName {
    // attributes of service

    // methods of service
    methodName(param: string) {
        // method logic
    }
}
```

**2. step**
- In a component **.ts file**, where you want to use the service, **import** the service first:
```typescript
import { ServiceName } from 'path-to-service/service-name.service.ts';
```

**3. step**
- **Inject** the service to the **constructor** of the component by adding access modifier and a name of the dependency as a **parameter** of type of the service class name: 
```typescript
export class ComponentName {
    constructor(private dependencyName: ServiceName) {}
}
```

**4. step**
- In a component **.ts file**, **add** a `providers` property to the _@Component_ decorator,
- assign the name of the service class as the **value** inside **brackets** `[ ]`:
 ```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'app-component-name',
    templateUrl: './component-name.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./component-name.component.css'],
    providers: [ServiceName]
})
```

**5. step**

In a component **.ts file**, **use** the instanciated service in your TypeScript code with `this.dependencyName.(method | attribute)`:
 ```typescript
 import { Component } from  '@angular/core';
 import { ServiceName } from 'path-to-service/service-name.service.ts';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-component-name',
    templateUrl: './component-name.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./component-name.component.css'],
    providers: [ServiceName]
})

export class ComponentName {
    constructor(private dependencyName: ServiceName) {}

    customMethod(message: string) {
    this.dependencyName.methodName(message);
    }
}
```

## ## Hierarchical Injector
- When service is provided to a certain component, Angular injects its instance **to the component** and **all of the children components of this component**,
- meaning, the component and all of its children components **receive the same instance** of the provided service.
- based on the hierarchical position of the injected service, the reach of the same instance of service can vary:
  1. `AppModule` => The same instance of service is available **application-wide** (whole app)
  1. `AppComponent` => The same instance of service is available for **all components**, not for **other services**
  1. `CustomComponent` => The same instance of service is available for the **component** and **all its children components**
